## Installation

run: cmake ./

Download SDL 1.2, and unzip it in this root folder. If you already have the SDL 1.2 in other place, please change the CMakeLists.txt

Then use Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 to open the solution.

Set the startup project to 'Project' rather than 'ALL_BUILD'

Run the project and enjoy it!
